#### A Technical Consultant by day ‚òº and a Full-Stack Developer by night ‚òæ

Technical Consultant at Wallstreetdocs (WSD);<br>
First-Class Computer Science Graduate from the University of Warwick;<br>

- ‚öôÔ∏è I use daily: `.php`, `.js`, `.py`, `.html`, `.css`
- üî≠ Here are some of my projects:

#### [Saiyan Lifts Tracker](https://github.com/Cheuktingchan/saiyan_lifts_tracker)
A performant and minimalistic workout tracker deployed as a mobile web app - designed for use in the gym using ethnographic testing. Say goodbye to your notes app and gamify your workouts.

#### [Network Topology in the Donation Game](https://github.com/Cheuktingchan/Donation-Game-Experiments)
An adaptation of the implementation of the donation game with generosity and forgiveness as reported in "Generosity and the Emergence of Forgiveness in the Donation Game" (published in ECAI 2023) by Nathan Griffiths. This adaptation allows for simulation on different network topologies (Random, Scale-Free, Small-World, Community and Bipartite) as the main research method for my university dissertation.

#### [Berserk Rat](https://github.com/Cheuktingchan/rat-in-sewers-game)
A 2D platformer where the aim is to reach the cheese as a sewer rat, but the twist is that movement is automatic after 10 seconds - berserk mode. A winning submission for the Pass the Torch Game Jam. Uses Phaser 3 for the game engine (TypeScript).

#### [Humines](https://github.com/Cheuktingchan/humines)
A Lumines clone made using Haskell as part of a Functional Programming module at university.
